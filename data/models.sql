Fgf23-/-/1 alpha (OH)ase-/- double knockout mice were generated by cross breeding heterozygous Fgf-23 mutants with 1 alpha (OH)ase mutants to obtain compound heterozygous animals, which were then interbred to generate desired double homozygous mutants [Fgf-23-/-/1 alpha (OH)ase-/-]. Routine PCR using genomic DNA, extracted from tail clips, was performed for genotyping of the various groups of mice (17, 21). Mice were fed a standard diet ad libidum containing 0.7% calcium, 0.6% phosphorus, and 3.2 IU/g vitamin D3 (PicoLab M. musculus Diet 20–5058). Animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were employed using protocols approved by the institution’s subcommittee on animal care (IACUC).	standard diet	Contains dependence	\N

When we measured the lifespan of rsks-1 mutants at 20°C, the animals tend to display a vulval extrusion phenotype, which required censoring of many animals. To circumvent this problem, we performed the lifespan assays mostly at 22.5°C after maintaining the worms at 22.5°C for at least two generations. We carried out the lifespan experiments for daf-2(e1370) or daf-2(e1370);rsks-1(tm1714) mutants at 20°C, because many of these animals arrested as dauer larvae at 22.5°C.	NGM	Contains dependence	\N

To obtain adult flies of defined ages or to determine the mean life span, stocks were cultured at 25 degrees C until 0 to 2 days post-eclosion, and then females or males only were removed and maintained at 40 flies per vial at 25 degrees C. The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	\N	\N

To obtain adult flies of defined ages or to determine the mean life span, stocks were cultured at 25 degrees C until 0 to 2 days post-eclosion, and then females or males only were removed and maintained at 40 flies per vial at 25 degrees C. The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Almost additive (negative)	CAT[2A2];SOD[3B2]

The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Dependent	CAT[2A2];SOD[3A1]

When we measured the lifespan of rsks-1 mutants at 20°C, the animals tend to display a vulval extrusion phenotype, which required censoring of many animals. To circumvent this problem, we performed the lifespan assays mostly at 22.5°C after maintaining the worms at 22.5°C for at least two generations. We carried out the lifespan experiments for daf-2(e1370) or daf-2(e1370);rsks-1(tm1714) mutants at 20°C, because many of these animals arrested as dauer larvae at 22.5°C.

The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Opposite lifespan effects of single mutants	CAT[2A2];SOD[3A1]

The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Enhancer, opposite lifespan effects	CAT[2B12];SOD[3B2]

To circumvent this problem, we performed the lifespan assays mostly at 22.5°C after maintaining the worms at 22.5°C for at least two generations. We carried out the lifespan experiments for daf-2(e1370) or daf-2(e1370);rsks-1(tm1714) mutants at 20°C, because many of these animals arrested as dauer larvae at 22.5°C.

As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter.

When we measured the lifespan of rsks-1 mutants at 20°C, the animals tend to display a vulval extrusion phenotype, which required censoring of many animals. To circumvent this problem, we performed the lifespan assays mostly at 22.5°C after maintaining the worms at 22.5°C for at least two generations. We carried out the lifespan experiments for daf-2(e1370) or daf-2(e1370);rsks-1(tm1714) mutants at 20°C, because many of these animals arrested as dauer larvae at 22.5°C.

To obtain adult flies of defined ages or to determine the mean life span, stocks were cultured at 25 degrees C until 0 to 2 days post-eclosion, and then females or males only were removed and maintained at 40 flies per vial at 25 degrees C. The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Antagonistic (negative)	CAT[2B12];SDO[3B2]

To obtain adult flies of defined ages or to determine the mean life span, stocks were cultured at 25 degrees C until 0 to 2 days post-eclosion, and then females or males only were removed and maintained at 40 flies per vial at 25 degrees C. The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Dependent	CAT[2B12];SOD[3A1]

To obtain adult flies of defined ages or to determine the mean life span, stocks were cultured at 25 degrees C until 0 to 2 days post-eclosion, and then females or males only were removed and maintained at 40 flies per vial at 25 degrees C. The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	\N	\N

To obtain adult flies of defined ages or to determine the mean life span, stocks were cultured at 25 degrees C until 0 to 2 days post-eclosion, and then females or males only were removed and maintained at 40 flies per vial at 25 degrees C. The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Opposite lifespan effects of single mutants	CAT[2A2];SOD[3A1]

To obtain adult flies of defined ages or to determine the mean life span, stocks were cultured at 25 degrees C until 0 to 2 days post-eclosion, and then females or males only were removed and maintained at 40 flies per vial at 25 degrees C. The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Antagonistic (negative)	CAT[2B2];SOD[3B2]

To obtain adult flies of defined ages or to determine the mean life span, stocks were cultured at 25 degrees C until 0 to 2 days post-eclosion, and then females or males only were removed and maintained at 40 flies per vial at 25 degrees C. The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	\N	CAT[2A2]

Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter.

The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Almost additive (negative)	CAT[2A2];SOD[3B2]

To obtain adult flies of defined ages or to determine the mean life span, stocks were cultured at 25 degrees C until 0 to 2 days post-eclosion, and then females or males only were removed and maintained at 40 flies per vial at 25 degrees C. The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Almost additive (negative)	CAT[2B2];SOD[3A1]

The adults were transferred to fresh vials every 2 days, and the number of dead flies was counted. As the age of the cohort increased, the number of vials was reduced to maintain approx. 40 flies per vial. Transgenic flies were generated by standard methods, using the w1118 recipient strain. All P element insertions were made homozygous by appropriate crosses to the same set of inbred balancer stocks in the w1118 background. Yeast FLP recombinase was used to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in adults. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span.	cornmeal-agar medium	Antagonistic (positive)	CAT[2B12];SOD[3B2]

L4s were moved into the appropriate conditions for the start of the aging experiment at a density of 10–12 worms per 6 cm plate. At the L4 stage, or day 0 of aging experiment, worms were moved to fresh experimental plates at density of 10–12 worms per plate. Worms were scored every other day across their lifespan for movement. To increase the efficacy of RNAi, RNAi sensitive strain nre-1(hd20);lin-15b(hd126) was used. 		Opposite lifespan effects of single mutants	\N
